# ScriptChem
A simplified JS version of SpaceChem

Welcome to ScriptChem.
This simplified JS version of the Zachtronics puzzle game SpaceChem was created in a short time just for fun.
To play, please open Home.html

Your goal is to get numbers from the blue input box and output them in the orange output box.
You will get two numbers. You will have to add or subtract them, and then output them.
If it failed, you will have to reload the page.
Click on the buttons on the right to place operations on the board.
The orange square will follow your path and perform the functions that the path tells it to perform.
Click on Run Test to initiate the test.


Have fun!
